# [*Course Certificate*](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/349704189f526e5c7a7a69975a6c901e1677d305cde6ae68b47e8e6e5dae62de)

- Design patterns are common solution to OOP.
- Advantages:
    - Not reinventing the wheel.
    - Building resilient code.
    - Preparing for future conditions.
    - They are not algorithms or code but experience.
- Design Patterns are not specific solution for specific softwares but a general solution. 
> Head First Design Patterns Book.
- Design Principles:
    - Inheritance.
    - Polymorphism.
    - Abstraction.
    - Encapsulation.
- Design Patterns: 
    - Strategy.
    - Iterator.
    - Factory.
    - Adaptor.
    - Decorator.
    - Observer.
     
> There are 23 Design Patterns.
- Inheritance => "**is a**" relationship.
    - Abstract => cannot instantiate the supperclass.
    - Overridding methods. 
- More overriding leads to duplicates and runtime behavior changes are difficult.
- Interface => an Abstract type:
    - Solves the problem of overriding but it destroys code reuse.
### Design Principles:
- Encapsulate what varies => fundamental to Design Patterns.
- Program to an Interface not an Implementation. 
- Favor Composition over Inheritance. 
- The Open-Closed Principle.
> HAS-A is better than IS-A.</br>
- Loosely coupled => Helps minimize the complexity: Observer design.
- Decorator pattern => composition.
- Review patterns that look like they will solve the problem.
- Simplicity and flexibility are the goal.
