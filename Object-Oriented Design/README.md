- Many languages are object oriented.
- Procedural languages like C: get from point A to point B, steps on order sequentially. 
- Code reusability is a main advantage of OOP.
- OOP is a programming paradiagm. 
- Logic Programming Language = Prolog.
- Functional Programming Language = Haskel.
- Object-Oriented Programming Languages = Go, python, java, JS, C# ...
- An object can contain other objects.
- All objects have: 
    - Identity: A's Mug
    - Attributes: color, size..
    - Behavior: full(), clean(), ...
- Objects can be nouns that you can add the before it => the mug, the person ...:    
    - Things.
    - Places.
    - People.
    - Ideas.
- Classes defines how the object behave. 
- Classes Components:
    - Name/type.
    - Attributes/properties or data.
    - Behaviors/ operations.
- Methods are defined as part of a class and can only access data that is known to their objects. 
- Instantiation: an object is an instance of a class.
- Frameworks and libraries:
    - Java class library.
    - .NET framework BCL.
    - C++ Standard Library.
    - Ruby Standard Library.
    - Python Standard Library.
- **Abstraction**:
    - Idea or concept of a person is different from someone else.
    - What should a class look like.
- **Polymorphism**:
    - Having many forms.
    - Dynamic Polymorphism: Overriding. 
    - Static Polyingmorphism: Overloading.
- **Inheritance**:
    - Inheritting same attributes and methods.
    - Any change in the supperclass(parent/base) will change the subclass(child/derived)
- **Encapsulation**:
    - Restrict access.
    - Black box testing. 
    - Reduce dependencies between other parts of the application.
### Object-Oriented:
- *Analysis*: Understand the problem => what you need to to do?
- *Design*: Finding the solution to the problem => how you will do it?
- *Programming*: Building the solution using the programming languages.
- **UML**: Unified Modeling Language. 
    - Graphical Notation to describe the Object-Oriented.
    - Structural and behavioral diagrams.
> *UML  Distilled by Martin Fowler*.</br>
> *Software Requirements by Karl Wiegers*. </br>
> *Mastering the requirements process by Suzanne and James Robertson*. </br>
> *Writing Effective Use Cases by Alistair Cockburn* 
- Conceptual Model: Identifies most important objects and the relation between them.
- CRC cards: Class Responsibility Collaboration. 
### Creating a Class Diagram:
- (+) means public and (-) means private. 
- Java, C#, C, C++ use new to instantiate a class.
- Constructor: Special method called when creating the object. 
    - Constructor doesn't have return.
    - Overloading. 
- Destructor: a method called when the object is already deleted. 
    - Finalizer.
- Instance variable.
- Static variable:
    - shared variable.
- Inheritance describes "'is a'" Relationship.
    - 'Extends' in java shows inheritance. 
- Abstract class: cannot be instantiated.
- Concrete class: has no children.
- Interface: collection of method in a class. Doesn't have any functionality.
- Aggregation: relationship between objects => 'Has a' or 'Has many' or 'uses a/many'
- Composition: is a form of aggregation that implies 'ownership'.
### OOP support in different languages:
- Java, C#, Swift => single inheritance.
- Python, C++ => multiple inheritance.
- Ruby => mixins.
- JS => prototypes.
- Ruby, JS, Python => dynamically typed.
- Java, C#, Swift, C++ => Statically typed.
- Programming Principles:
    - ***SOLID***
    - ***DRY***
    - ***YAGNI***
