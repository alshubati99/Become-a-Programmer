### Security and Risk Overview:
- Security Minded Developer.
- Most effective person on workplace is the developer. 
- Development Manager:
    - What the team is doing.
    - What the team spend time on.
    - What risks are being solved.
- Project Mangaer:
    - Why tasks take as long as they do.
    - How security and secure coding can impact timelines.
- Quality Control:
    - Identify risks.
    - Identify exploits.
    - Attack exploits.
    - More effective tests.
> security has its impact on the development team.
- Cyberattacker:
    - Tear down what a person builds. 
    - Part of understanding secure code is understanding the attacker mindset. 
    - Attacker's motivations:
        - Financial.
        - Political.
        - Revenge.
        - Reputation building.
- Security tester:
    - Why attackers may disrupt the software?
    - Recognize the mindset of attackers. 
    - Build attack tree.
> Learn basics of attacking systems such as writing exploit attacks. 
- Benefits of Attack Knowledge:
    - Data access and use.
    - Logging output from creation to consumption.
    - Increased knowledge of overall code base.
    - More interactions with security professionals.
    - Better cross-team collaboration.
- Constructive conversations with security professionals.
- Decreased bug fixed time.
- Better testing knowledge.
> Take time to learn the basics.
- Understand the risks.
    - Focus on high risks areas.
    - Do planning meetings to discuss the potential risks.
- Document your code:
    - There is a value in documentation in security. 
### Web Interaction Code Issues:
- **Input validation issues**:
    - Injection attacks => SQL injection.
    - Scripting attacks => XSS attack
    - Fixes for them is Blacklisting, Whitelising. 
    - Validation is server side. 
- **Communication channel issues**:
    - Like Free Wifi.
    - TLS, SSL
    - Client side validation.
- Session management issues:
    - Session Hijacking.
    - Secure the session token. 
    - Think about risks and make a global plan. 
- **Error Handling issues**:
    - User authentication flaws. 
    - Error conditions will always occur. 
    - Consistent Language:
        - Review the text.
        - Don't disclose system information.
        - Don't display user's information.
- **Logging and output issues**:
    - Internal Functionality.
    - User information.
    - Log items: Events, Errors.
    - General application flow and connection details.
    - Credentials, connection strings, session,event tokens, encryption operations, keys and passwords should not be logged. 
- **Internal and data management issues**:
    - Connecting to remote service.
    - Never commit sensitive information to source control.
    - Consider certificates when securing client server applications.
- **Configuration issues**:
    - Configuration is software and OS are running on. 
    - Mitigate attacks:
        - Package beta software separately.
        - Deliver directly to trusted beta testers.
        - Reduce risk of feature flags.
        - Consider configuration on runtime. 
        - OWASP => Open Web App Security Project. 
- **Database issues**:
    - SQL injection. 
    - Secure communication channels.
    - Main target for attackers.
- **File I/O issues**:
    - Set permissions. 
    - Leverage read-only files.
    - Don't allow file uploads.
    - Input validations.
- **Memory Management issues**:
    - Buffer Overflow attack. 
    - Deal with data structures.
    - Mitigations:
        - Randomize memory allocations.
        - Point, execution space, stack protection
        - Fix three phased approach:
            - Native protections.
            - Input validation.
            - Good testing strategy. 
- **Dependency Management issues**:
    - Find issues.
    - Identify these issues. 
    - Leverage dependence scan tools. 
    - Detailed analysis. 
    - Stay on top of dependencies.
- **Authentication and password issues**:
    - Time it takes to perform authentication.
    - Hashing Brute Force attack. 
    - Never store users' passwards even if was encrypted.
    - Leverage short-lived unique links for passwards resets.
    - Never allow passwards manipulation.
- **Authorization and access control issues**:
    - ACLs => Access Control lists if not applied correctly can produce defects.
    - Always require logout and login permissions.
    - Every transaction should check authorization. 
    - Mitigations:
        - Good process/ controls to review ACLs.
        - Good reviews.
        - Documentation of ACLs and changes.
        - Good testing  strategy.
        - Positive and negitive testing.
- **Cryptography issues**:
    - Use of broken cryptographic routines.
    - Mitigations:
        - Use greatest and latest algorithms.
        - Use not cracked algorithms.
        - Keep tabs on what you use in case you need to upgrad.
    - Common Algorithms Misunderstanding:
        - Intialization vectors.
        - Salt.
        - Nonce.
        - Should not be ignored.
    - Misunderstanding Mitigations:
        - If you don't know, Ask!.
        - It is okay to not know everything.
        - It can be almost as bad to misuse algorithms as not to use them.
> Faster algorithms give attacker a better chance to hack the system because they give attackers more operations per unit of time to brute force a passward.
### Security in the SDLC:
- *Embrace security in design phase*:
    - Use critical eye with your features.
    - Identify weak points.
    - Look for injection or memory attacks.
    - Look for database issues.
    - Create an inventory of risks.
> Start the conversation of security in the ealy phase of development. 
- *Embrace security in development phase*:
    - Live to learn.
    - Blogs and Twitter.
    - Focus on well known InfoSec and AppSec source.
    - Test your own skills.
    - Be humble.
    - You will make mistakes, just own it.
    - Development is hard, but security is harder.
- *Embrace security in Testing phase*:
    - Write tests to ensure that mitigations are right.
    - Leverage the risk register.
    - Pen Testing Tools:
        - Be willing to take the lead.
        - Some learning curve to use.
        - Biggerr learning curve to interpret.
        - Make a testing plan.
- *Embrace security in deployment*:
    - Use of files in a file system.
    - Sophisticated APIs.
    - Automation, can preven internal attacks.
    - Secure machines that do the deployment.
- *Implement best practices*:
    - Focus on best practices.
    - Consider source control, unit testing, dynamic code analysis and peer reviews to help secure your code. 
    - Risk management has huge focus.
    - Vulnarbiliy management. 
>> Focus on breaking and not just building.
